		<h1>About Heather</h1>
		
		<p>I'm a graphic designer and illustrator with experience in front-end development. Coming up with inventive designs and finding ways to improve my workflow is how I like to roll! I have experience maintaining document libraries of varying types and needs, and have successfully delivered trade show graphics in a matter of hours. My diverse background in marketing, education and web design helps lend a different perspective to problem-solving.</p>
		
		<p>My strongest talents are in the Adobe Creative Suite and Microsoft Office. I'm most adept with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator but will happily pick up new software; I swiftly learned InDesign to maintain libraries of product briefs, white papers, ebooks and more. I've also figured out how to do basic video editing, taking a crash course on captioning videos in Premiere Pro in order to deliver for events.</p>
		
		<p>In my free time, I like to make fun illustrations of my favourite things. I also enjoy playing video games and taking mini road-trips.</p> 
		
		<p>I'm eager to be part of a close-knit team and learn from fellow designers to push my talents even further. And, to boost morale, I'll even bake fresh chocolate chip cookies! Located in Sunnyvale, I'm looking for in-house opportunities in and around Silicon Valley.</p>
